# Libbingo

Libbingo is a minimal implementation of the baremetal task dependency management runtime. It enables the auto dependency check and dispatch of the task on the HeMAiA platform (Heterogenous Multiple Ai Accelerator).

The goal is to ease the programming effort on the heterogenous platform. 

The design follows largely on the llvm openmp libomptarget.
